# Heat-exchanger

This system is used to control the temperature of a water bolus to prevent high skin temperature during 
heating of tumors.
The primary side is connected to hot and cold tap water and it is controlled by 2 servo ball valves.
After the water is mixed to the desided temperature using tempsensor on the outlet of the heat echanger, it goes to waste.
In the secondaryside is also a tempsensor connect to the 
the return of the water bolus loop to increase the temperature control.
The system is controlled by a Arduino UNO.
